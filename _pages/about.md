Introduction
==========
I am a research assistant, handling adequate skills relevant to bioinformatics. 
When I was a college student. I majored in Biotechnology and I was really interested in not only biology and computer science. So, I tried to learn bioinformatics. Fortunately, there were some high-quality CS classes in my curriculum. Also, I learned Python and R by myself. During that time, I was attracted by machine learning, then I learned the knowledge about it and tried some classic machine learn projects like hand-written digits recognition.
